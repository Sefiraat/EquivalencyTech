[![Build Status](https://thebusybiscuit.github.io/builds/Sefiraat/EquivalencyTech/master/badge.svg)](https://thebusybiscuit.github.io/builds/Sefiraat/EquivalencyTech/master)

## Features
The plugin currently features:
* EMC!
  * Turn any unwanted items into EMC
  * Synthesize your stored EMC into any other item you want!
  * Server owners have full control over the base EMC values of items
  * Items that are crafted have their EMC generated based off of these base values (e.g. Diamond = 1000 emc, Diamond Block will automatically be 9000)
  * Server owners can override this behavior if required by adding the item into the base.
* Transmutation Orb
  * This key item lets users input their unwanted items to convert them to EMC.
  * The first time a new item is added, it is 'learned'.
  * Learned items can be synthesized using stored EMC.
* Dissolution Chest
  * Any items placed/hopped/trasnfered via cargo into this chest will slowly be dissolved into EMC added directly into the players EMC pool
* Condensate Chest
  * Shift + Click a Condensate chest with an item to assign it's production type. Assuming the player has enough EMC and the item can be synthesized, the items will begin production.
* Slimefun
  * If Slimefun is installed, this plugin's recipes will be added to the Slimefun Guide. **This plugin does not require Slimefun to run**

## Planned Features
* Automation Upgrades
  * Upgrades to MK2 - MK3 chests for faster throughput
* Slimefun
  * As at this first release, only vanilla items + EquiTech items can be condensed / synthesized. A Future update will allow for Slimefun core items to also be added.
* DankTech
  * The addition of a new type of pack to DankTech that converts voided items into EMC with a % loss
  * The addition of a new type of pack that builds from assigned slots using EMC.

## Thanks!

A big thanks to the owners of **mct.tantrum.org** who have tested nearly everything I have made and really given me direction and drive to make these things.

Another big shoutout to **GentlemanCheesy** of **mc.talosmp.net** for being my first (and as of writing this, only!) sponsor. A few coffee's a month to make me feel better about making these addons <3
